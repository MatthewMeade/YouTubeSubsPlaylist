# YouTube Subscriptions Playlist Tool

A 'Play All' button for your feed

Connect your YouTube account and create a playlist from the videos in your Subscriptions Feed

Create a bookmark to your playlist that automatically updates it when you click

## How it works

The app runs in your browser, so no information about you or your Google account is collected.  

1.  Sign in with your Google account and grant permissions to the app
2.  Click start or use the auto update bookmark
3.  A playlist attached to your YouTube account is created
4.  A list of the channels you are subscribed to is retrieved from your account
5.  The app fetches all the videos recently uploaded by your subscriptions
6.  The playlist is updated with any new videos
7.  Get redirected to your playlist and start watching :)
